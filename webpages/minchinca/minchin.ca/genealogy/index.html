            <p>I got into Genealogy a few years back, and started by transcribing a few
of the books we had laying around from family reunions into my genealogy
program on the computer. These books typically start with a common
ancestor and work down to cover all their descendants (it theory, those
people that could show up at said family reunion). The downside is I
have several thousand people in my database, but many of them are living
cousins rather than my ancestors. I have managed to add many ancestors,
with the furthest back lines stretching to the 4th century AD Wales.
Several lines immigrated to Canada around 1800.</p>

<p>Below is an overview of some of my ancestral lines:</p>
<h2>Minchin</h2>
<div class="text-center img-responsive">
<p><img alt="Minchin Coat of Arms" src="images/minchin-tipperary.gif" /></p>
</div>
<p>The Minchin line is probably my best researched line. The Minchin’s left
Ireland about 1802 to settle in Prince Edward Island (PEI) (then a
British colony; this is some 60 years before Canada was even a
country!). <strong><a href="profile-I106.html">Humphrey Howard Minchin</a></strong> (abt. 1761 -
1849) was the one that made the move from Ireland to Canada. He operated
a ferry in New Ross, Co. Wexford, Ireland before he moved to PEI, and
operated a ferry across Charlottetown harbour once he got to PEI. The
family lived in PEI for several generations. <strong><a href="profile-I17.html">Alex
Minchin</a></strong> (1890 - 1963) (my great-grandfather) was
born in PEI but eventually settled in Saskatchewan to farm. During the
Dirty Thirties (the 1930’s), the drought was so bad in Saskatchewan that
Alex took the family back to PEI to live and farm potatoes with his
parents. My Grandpa was a kid at the time and he remembers living in
PEI.</p>
<p>Reaching back further in time, the Minchin’s came to Ireland from
Gloucestershire, in England near the Welsh border. It was <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I580.html">Colonel
Charles Minchin</a></strong> (abt. 1628-1681) that came to
Ireland, with two of his brothers. Charles is my 8th great-grandfather.
At the time, the English crown was looking to send Protestants to
Ireland to have a stronger Protestant presence there. Basically, if you
were Protestant and didn’t mind living in Ireland, you could have an
estate there. This was probably pretty enticing as, at the time, if you
weren’t the oldest son you inherited next to nothing. On the Minchin
coat of arms (above), the three red chevrons are for Gloucestershire.
The coat of arms was awarded to the Minchin family within a couple
generations of their arrival in Ireland.</p>
<p>Going back further than Gloucestershire, the records get fuzzier. The
family likely came over to England with the Anglo-Saxons from Saxony (a
region in modern day Germany) in the 6th century AD.</p>
<p>Other Minchin’s around the world:</p>
<div class="real-list">
<ul>
<li><strong>The Boer War (South Africa)</strong>: During the siege of Mafeking,
    Robert Banden-Powell (who later founded Scouting) established his
    offices above those of a lawyer by the name of Minchin. I have heard
    that you can still take tours of the office today.</li>
<li><strong>Minchinbury Estates</strong>: An officer in the British army by the name
    of Minchin was given an estate in New South Wales, Australia. He was
    a contemporary of Captain Bligh, and opposed some of Bligh's
    politics. A few years later, his entire family was lost at sea. The
    estate was sold, and eventually developed into a winery. Minchinbury
    champagne is considered quite excellent. In recent years, the winery
    closed and the area was redeveloped as housing. A fighter jet on a
    pedestal now sits at the entrance.</li>
<li><strong>Minchinhampton, England</strong>: An former market town in England. I'm
    told that the last Minchin living there died about 15 years ago.</li>
<li><strong>Minchin, Texas</strong>: close to Dallas/Fort Worth, in Denton County. I
    actually went looking for this a couple years ago, hoping to get a
    cool picture with the town sign. I asked at the county historical
    museum, and they had never heard of it. When I went looking on the
    ground, I didn't find anything labelled 'Minchin', and the people
    working at the Roselawn Cemetary (right in the supposed centre of
    Minchin) had no idea either. I looked in up online, and Minchin was
    labeled on MapQuest, but not Google Maps (this was 2009). So I'm not
    convinced this really exists.</li>
<li><strong>Minchin Lake, New Zealand</strong>: Named after a runholder who worked
    the area.</li>
<li><strong>Minchin Mason Lodge</strong>: There is a Mason Lodge in India, founded by
    a Minchin.</li>
<li><strong>Minchin</strong>: A geological formation in South America.</li>
<li><strong>Tim Minchin</strong>: A comedian from Australia.</li>
<li><strong>Nick Minchin</strong>: An Australian politician. He is currently serving
    as the Minister of Finance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Walcot</h2>
<p>Soon after the Minchin’s arrived in Ireland, they married into the
Walcot line. This line can be traced back to kings in Wales to about 325
AD!</p>
<h2>Bull</h2>
<p>I don’t know much about this line. The family seems to come from
Ireland.</p>
<h2>McLaren</h2>
<p>I don’t know much at all about this line, but that they came from
Scotland and came to PEI between 1770 and 1809. I’ll have to look into
this more; this well could be our oldest tie to Canada and the New
World.</p>
<h2>Shaw</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I1154.html">Allan Shaw</a></strong> was born in 1803 en route to
Canada. I have lots of old ties to Canada! Allan’s father, <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I1156.html">Donald
Shaw</a></strong>, (1768 - 1836) is from Colonsay Island,
Scotland, an island just west of mainland Scotland that measures 2 miles
by 10 miles and has a population of 135 today. I’ll have to look more
into this…</p>
<h2>Lamont</h2>
<p>The Lamont’s are also from Scotland (in this case, the Island of Skye)
and seem to have come to PEI in the early 1800’s.</p>
<h2>Seaman</h2>
<p>The Seaman line goes back to <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I125.html">Robert Seaman</a></strong>
(1641-1693) and <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I126.html">Alice Shuckforth</a></strong> (1630-1709).
The family goes back to Suffolk, England. <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I110.html">William
Seaman</a></strong> (1792 - 1864) and <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I111.html">Hephzebah Chaman
Wells</a></strong> (1798 - 1865) came to PEI about 1830 from
England.</p>
<h2>Wells</h2>
<p>The Wells line goes back to <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I9688.html">Peter Wells</a></strong> (abt.
1620 - abt. Nov 1693) and
<strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I9689.html">Jane</a></strong> (died abt.
Dec. 1667), again to Suffolk, England.</p>
<h2>Jewell</h2>
<p>It thought we had more on the Jewell line. I know my Dad used to have a
book on the Jewell family, but unfortunately we haven’t been able to
find it for the last couple of years. The Jewell family goes back to
Deveonshire, England and immigrated to PEI in about 1830.</p>
<h2>Sinnamon</h2>
<p>We don’t have a long recorded history of the Sinnamon’s, but my Grandma
says the family came out of France years and years ago (probably the
16th century). The family were Huguenots (a persecuted group of
Protestants) who were forced from France to Scotland. They were
illiterate when they left France and so their last name (then ‘Saint
Amand’) got written down by the Scottish authorities as ‘Sinnamon’.</p>
<h2>Bunbury</h2>
<div class="text-center img-responsive">
<p><img alt="Bunbury Coat of Arms" src="images/bunbury-wexford.gif" /></p>
</div>
<p>The Bunbury’s are an old line. We have it traced back to 1066 when the
<strong>Baron de Saint Pierre</strong> came to England from Normandy with William the
Conqueror. The Baron was given a town in northern England (Bunbury) and
thus became <strong>de Bunbury</strong>, and eventually just <strong>Bunbury</strong>. The
Bunbury’s have often been involved in the British or English military.
In time, they too ended up in Ireland.</p>
<p>The Bunbury’s first came to Canada with <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I154.html">George John
Bunbury</a></strong> (1888-1969), my great-grandfather. With
his father (<strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I157.html">George William Bunbury</a></strong> (1835 -
1898)) in the Army in India, he (George, the son) got himself kicked out
of boarding school. So at age 15 (about 1903, before Alberta was a
province) he was sent to Canada to work as a farmhand. He worked around
High River, Alberta. George would eventually homestead near Castor,
Alberta, and that land is still in the family. George’s wife, <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I155.html">Sarah
Whiteside</a></strong> (1897 - 1983) was from a working class
family in Belfast and originally came as a nanny to work for George.
(George would actually have three wives in his lifetime. Sarah came over
to look after the children of George's first wife, <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I166.html">Greta
Lynes</a></strong> (d. 1920) who died in childbrith.)</p>
<p>Other Bunbury’s around the world:</p>
<div class="real-list">
<ul>
<li><strong>Bunbury, Prince Edward Island</strong>: I'd need to find it on a map
    again, but I think it exists...</li>
<li><strong>Bunbury, Australia</strong>: The Bunburys were active in the British
    military, and they got a city of Australia's west coast named after
    them. The city is not far from Perth.</li>
<li><strong>Bunbury Road, Valmont, BC, Canada</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bunbury Castles, Ireland</strong>: Twin castles built in Tipperary
    county, Ireland, not far from the Balarny stone, for a set of
    Bunbury brothers in the 18th or 19th century. I have not been able
    to confirm their exact locations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>McGowan</h2>
<div class="text-center img-responsive">
<p><img alt="Hotel MacDonald" src="images/OldMac2.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>The McGowan’s go back to Scotland. My Grandma was telling me some of the
story last time she visited. <strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I357.html">David McGowan Sr.</a></strong>
(1873-1956) (my great-great grandfather) worked on the docks in Glasgow,
Scotland, and played music (a harmonica?) for various gatherings.
<strong><a href="http://minchin.ca/genealogy/profile-I358.html">Jane McCover</a></strong> (1876 - 1963) met him at one of
these gatherings when she had gone to Glasgow to do shopping with her
Mom. David and Jane were married in Scotland. The family moved to
Alberta (or what would soon be Alberta) about 1904. They first came to
Edmonton, one of four families that were friends in Scotland that had
come to homestead Canada. The first year, they (the men of the four
families) worked on the Hotel MacDonald (pictured above) to earn money.
The next year they set off for Galahad, where they homesteaded on four
adjacent quarters. That was the farm that my Great Grandma McGowan used
to live on when I'd visit her as a kid. My uncle owns and farms that
quarter now.</p>
