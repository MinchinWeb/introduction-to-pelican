title: HTML Was Simple

<!-- section is Static vs Dynamic Websites -->

There was a time when you could write HTML in Notepad

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Simple Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>I can write anything I want here. Add some <b>bold</b> or
        <i>italics</i> text. For everything else, I'll send you to
        <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

which then looks like this:

<p>I can write anything I want here. Add some <b>bold</b> or
<i>italics</i> text. For everything else, I'll send you to
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>!</p>

**This is foundational!**
